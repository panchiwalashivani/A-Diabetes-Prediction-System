# A-Diabetes-Prediction-System
This dataset is an interesting one and aims at predicting the probability of the onset of diabetes. I, as an Indian was interested in this dataset and this is my take on this dataset. The objective of this project is to build a predictive machine learning model to predict based on diagnostic measurements whether a patient has diabetes. This is a binary (2-class) classification project with supervised learning.
